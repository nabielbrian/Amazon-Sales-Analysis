# ðŸ“Š Amazon Sales Analysis


## ðŸ“Œ Background
Amazon, as one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, faces challenges in managing multiple product categories (Bikes, Accessories, and Clothing) and understanding customer purchasing behavior. Despite having large amounts of sales data, Amazon struggles to identify the most profitable products and customer segments, making it difficult to design effective marketing strategies.

This project aims to optimize revenue by analyzing product categories, customer segments, geographic distribution, and seasonal sales trends. The main objectives are:

- Identify the most profitable products and categories.

- Build targeted marketing strategies based on customer segmentation.

- Optimize sales by seasonal trends and geographic location.

- Increase revenue by focusing on specific high-value customer segments.


## ðŸŽ¯ SMART Goal

- How is the sales distribution across product categories?

- Is there a relationship between customer age and total purchase value?

- How does customer geography (country/state) affect purchase volume?

- What are the monthly sales trends, and are there seasonal patterns?

- Are there outliers in revenue, unit cost, or quantity sold?

-  Is there a significant revenue difference between male and female customers?
